This project builds a recursive 7z bomb, inspired by 42.zip. It uses ultra-compressed data that expands exponentially on extraction. The final archive is a tiny `.7z` file (e.g. 23 KB) but can extract into petabytes of data

This tool is purely for **educational** and **research** purposes â€” mainly to learn about compression, recursion, and file structure abuse.

How does it work?

* Starts with a highly compressible file (e.g. 430MB of repeated `A`s).
* Compresses it using `7z` with LZMA2 for extreme size reduction (e.g. down to 23KB).
* Recursively nests this `.7z` file inside new `.7z` containers.
* Each level contains 16 copies of the previous archive, inflating uncompressed size massively while keeping disk size small.

### Math:

`size_layer_N = 16^N * base_size`

Where `base_size` is \~430 MB (0.43 GB). The following is theoretical and assumes ideal decompression behavior.
